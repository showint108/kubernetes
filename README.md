## container runtime

Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that encapsulate an application and its dependencies, allowing for consistent deployment across various environments.

A container runtime is a software component responsible for running and managing containers on a host system.

The container runtime interacts with the underlying operating system's kernel to create and manage isolated containers. 

Container runtimes work under the hood by leveraging the features provided by the Linux kernel to create and manage isolated environments for running applications. 

The key technologies involved in container runtimes include namespaces, control groups (cgroups), and the container format.

Container runtimes work under the hood by leveraging the features provided by the Linux kernel to create and manage isolated environments for running applications. The key technologies involved in container runtimes include namespaces, control groups (cgroups), and the container format.

Here's a high-level overview of how container runtimes work:

1. **Namespaces:**
   - **What They Are:** Namespaces provide isolation for various system resources, making it appear to processes within a namespace that they have their own isolated instance of those resources.
   - **How They're Used:** Container runtimes use namespaces to create isolated environments for processes, including the process ID (PID) namespace (isolating processes), network namespace (isolating network interfaces and routing tables), mount namespace (isolating filesystem mounts), and more.
   - **Example:** A containerized application in its own PID namespace won't see or interfere with processes outside its namespace.

2. **Control Groups (cgroups):**
   - **What They Are:** Control groups are a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation of resources and setting limits on resource usage for processes.
   - **How They're Used:** Container runtimes use cgroups to restrict and isolate resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O for containerized processes.
   - **Example:** A container can be limited to using a specific amount of CPU or memory, preventing it from monopolizing resources on the host.

3. **Container Format:**
   - **What It Is:** Containers are packaged using a specific format that includes the application code, runtime, libraries, and other dependencies needed to run the application.
   - **How It's Used:** Container runtimes use this format to create and manage containers. Common container formats include the Docker image format and the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format.
   - **Example:** Docker images are layered and include a filesystem snapshot with the application code and dependencies. The container runtime extracts this snapshot into an isolated filesystem for the container.

4. **Container Lifecycle:**
   - **Container Creation:** The container runtime pulls the container image from a registry, extracts the filesystem, and sets up the necessary namespaces and cgroups.
   - **Container Execution:** The runtime starts the containerized process within the isolated environment, and the process runs as if it were on its own system.
   - **Resource Management:** The runtime enforces resource limits using cgroups, ensuring that the containerized processes do not consume more resources than allocated.
   - **Container Termination:** When the containerized application completes its execution or is manually stopped, the runtime cleans up the associated resources, namespaces, and cgroups.

Here is a list of popular container runtimes:
- Docker
- containerd
- rkt (pronounced "rocket")
- cri-o
- Podman
- LXC (Linux Containers)

The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) is a component of the Kubernetes container orchestration system that defines the interface between Kubernetes and container runtimes. It enables Kubernetes to be container runtime-agnostic, allowing users to choose and swap out different container runtimes without affecting the overall Kubernetes infrastructure. The CRI was introduced to address the need for a standardized way for Kubernetes to communicate with container runtimes.

CRI Components:

- kubelet: The kubelet is a core component of the Kubernetes node responsible for managing containers. With CRI, the kubelet interacts with container runtimes through the CRI to start, stop, and manage containers.

- CRI Runtime: The CRI runtime is the specific implementation of the CRI interface by a container runtime. Examples include containerd, cri-o, and others. Each CRI runtime must implement the CRI API for communication with Kubernetes.

- CRI Shim: The CRI shim is a lightweight component that translates between the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and the internal API of a container runtime. It serves as an adapter to bridge the communication between Kubernetes and the underlying container runtime.

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an open-source project that focuses on creating a set of industry standards for container runtimes and image formats. OCI was launched in 2015 with the goal of ensuring container technology's interoperability and providing a set of specifications that allow different container runtimes and platforms to work together seamlessly.

Key components and concepts related to the OCI standard include:

**OCI Specifications:**
   - **Runtime Specification:** Defines the configuration and execution environment for a container runtime. It specifies how to create and run a container, including details such as the filesystem, environment variables, and lifecycle hooks.
   
   - **Image Specification:** Defines the format and structure of container images. It specifies how container images are built, signed, and distributed. The image specification includes information about layers, manifests, and configuration files.

Docker relies on containerd as its default and primary container runtime. When you run a container using Docker, it utilizes containerd for the low-level container operations. Docker builds on top of containerd, adding features and a higher-level user interface to simplify container management.
